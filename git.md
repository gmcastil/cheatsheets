# Branches
## Create a Branch from Working Copy
A common thing to do is to start working from the main or master branch and then
desire to create a branch from unstaged changes.


# History
## Diff with Previous Commit
In Git, `HEAD` is a reference to the currently checked out commit (or branch).
Appending the `~` character references one commit prior the currently checked
out commit.  Appending a `~~` 
When you append ~~ to HEAD, it means "two commits before the currently checked
out commit." So, `HEAD~~` refers to the grandparent commit of the currently
checked out commit.

In other words, if you imagine the commit history as a chain, HEAD~~ points to
the commit two generations behind the commit you currently have checked out.
